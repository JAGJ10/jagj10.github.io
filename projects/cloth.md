### A CUDA/C++ Fluid-Cloth Two-Way Coupling ###

![A frame from the simulation](../images/cloth.png)
*1k fluid particles were dropped onto a cloth of 4k vertices. Two-way coupling is realized, evident by the fluid pushing the cloth down.*

### Overview ###
This is a follow-up project to my [Position Based Fluids](http://jagj10.github.io/projects/pbf.html) implementation.
