    <p>My name is Joel Gross and I try to create awesome effects and games. I have degrees in Computer Science and Economics from Binghamton University and a Masters in Computer Science from Cornell University. My main interests and strengths are physics simulations, game development, and rendering. I currently work at Lightstorm Entertainment on the Avatar Sequels as the main graphics engineer, working on particle systems, shaders, and other real-time rendering tasks. I previously worked at DreamWorks Animation on the shading team.</p><br>
