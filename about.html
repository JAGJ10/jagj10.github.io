    <p>My name is Joel Gross and I try to create awesome effects and games. I have degrees in Computer Science and Economics from Binghamton University and a Masters in Computer Science from Cornell University. My main interests and strengths are physics simulations, game development, and rendering. I am currently seeking employment and hope to continue pursuing my goal of making things come alive on the screen.</p><br>
