<div class="post">
    <p>My name is Joel Gross and I try to create awesome effects and games. I have degrees in Computer Science and Economics from Binghamton University and currently attend Cornell University where I am earning a Masters degree in Computer Science. While at Cornell I have focused on physics simulations, game development, and rendering. Upon graduation I hope to find a job in the movie or gaming industries so that I can continue to make things come alive on the screen.</p><br>
