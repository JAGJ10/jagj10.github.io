    <p>My name is Joel Gross and I try to create awesome effects and games. I have degrees in Computer Science and Economics from Binghamton University and a Masters in Computer Science from Cornell University. My main interests and strengths are physics simulations, game development, and rendering. I currently work at DreamWorks Animation on the shading team where I help develop and maintain DreamWorks' in-house shaders for both their REYES and MCRT renderers.</p><br>
